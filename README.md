A simple CLI [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) client for environments where resources are scarce.

So got an [Asus ChromeBook Flip](https://www.asus.com/us/Notebooks/ASUS_Chromebook_Flip_C100PA/) and I installed [crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) on it (translation: I now have a tiny laptop that's also a tablet with Linux on it and it also has a super optimized version of Google Chrome on it). I ran into trouble though when I wanted to start using Dropbox. There were three issues:

1. There doesn't seem to be a Linux Dropbox client for [ARM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) (and the Flip appears to me an ARM machine).
2. After installing crouton and a few necessities I only have about 7 gigibyte left.  My dropbox is currently at about half that but I don't exactly want to use it all up right away.
3. I intend to use this machine on the go because it seems to tether nicely with my phone via USB and I don't exactly want a bunch of extra background network traffic using up my data plan.

Also, I'd been looking for a fun DIY project to work on now that I once again had a tiny, highly portable, Linux machine.

so what does this thing do??

It uses the [Dropbox API](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/documentation) and the [NodeJS HTTPS library](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) to implent 3 commands:

- List files in a directory
